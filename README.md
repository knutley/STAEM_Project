**St Andrews Holyrood Election Monitoring Project**
*@Kieran, you can think of a snappier name later.* 

## What is this?

A PhD student-led initiative using the upcoming Scottish Parliament (Holyrood) election as a hands-on opportunity to teach ourselves and undergraduates about quantitative methods and the electoral process. The aim is to cover electoral norms, polling behaviour, quantitative methods, and then write up a small blogpost with our undergraduates after the Holyrood elections in E-IR! 

## Data Sources

All data used in this project is publicly available and sourced from established third parties, primarily:

- [What Scotland Thinks](https://whatscotlandthinks.org/)
- [Ballot Box Scotland](https://ballotbox.scot/)

None of the data here is proprietary.

## Get Involved

We're students, not electoral scientists — and we know it. If you work in elections, polling, or Scottish politics and you're open to sharing your expertise, we'd love to hear from you. We're also happy to offer data visualisation in return. Get in touch at kn32@st-andrews.ac.uk.
